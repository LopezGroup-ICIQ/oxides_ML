# Notes:
# - These pins reflect the project's development target: torch 2.6.0 + torch-geometric 2.6.1.
# - For GPU (CUDA 12.4) installs follow the INSTALL.md GPU section which includes exact conda + pip wheel commands
#   to ensure the PyG companion wheels (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, torch-spline-conv) match torch+CUDA.
